- 3 points if you are off by 1 position. (Ex. You predicted Afghanistan will finish 3rd, but if Afghanistan finished 2nd or 4th, you get 3 points.)
- 2 Points if you are off by 2 positions. If you predict a team will finish #1, but if it finishes #3, you get 2 points
- 1 point if you are off by 3 positions. If you predict a team will finish #4, but it ends up in the top spot, you get 1 point.
- 0 points if you pick a team that does not qualify in the top 4 spots
- The maximum possible score in the Group Stage is **16 points**. (4 x 4)
